## Briefing About My Previous Projects  

**I have a hybrid background (Computer Network manager, translator and poet)** which allows me to be always prone to learn and keep in mind the user's point of view. That's why learning is always a requirement for any new project. By now I've worked in _Aplicaciones Informáticas Domingo Alonso (AIDA)_, _Infinera_, and _Mercedes-Benz.io_ so far learning different skills and tools and achieving different goals as shown in the following table:
