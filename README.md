# Technical-Write Me in mkdocs-material    

> Test environment for mkdocs-material static site generator

## Overview  

**My name is Javier and I'm a senior technical writer**. I love learning. That's why I'm a technical writer: to learn continuously (from users, developers and subject matter experts) and then being able to ease the process of how they communicate with each other. I communicate features, processes, designs and ideas. I share knowledge too with the community.  

**It is all about learning the language and the needs of users,** finding a way for communication to be accomplished and feeding an agile and lean mindset. Software development projects are one of the best environments for that.

For example, now I am keep on learning Python programming, prompting in Large Language Models and GitHub Actions to draft complete my toolset and provide more value to my teams.

Sound cool, right?  

## Blog Structure
