# About Me       

## Presentation

**My name is Javier Hernández, alias _Doc_, and I'm a senior technical writer**. I love learning. That's why I'm a technical writer: to learn continuously (from users, developers and subject matter experts) and then being able to ease the process of how they communicate with each other.   

*I communicate ideas, concepts, features, processes and designs, and support development teams.*  

**It is all about learning the language and the needs of users,** finding a way for communication to be accomplished and feeding an agile and lean mindset. Software development projects are one of the best environments for that.

**Now I am learning** Python (for AI and scripting), Large Language Models (LLMs) _prompting_ and GitHub Actions.
Sound cool, right?
