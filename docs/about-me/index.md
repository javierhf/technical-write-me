# About Me       

## Overview

**My name is Javier Hernández, alias Doc, and I'm a senior technical writer.** I love learning, that's why I'm a technical writer:  

* to learn continuously (from users, developers, and subject-matter experts)  

* to be able to ease the process of how they communicate with each other  

* to help the product development team achieve their documentation goals

**Technical writing is all about learning** the language and the needs of your readers  and finding a way for successful communication.   

## Previous Projects  

**I'm a computer network manager, and translator (a literary critic and a poet too).** This hybrid background allows me to be always prone to learn and keep in mind the users' (readers') point of view. That's why learning is one of my requirements to get involved in a new project.
