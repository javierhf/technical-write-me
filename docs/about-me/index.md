# About Me       

## Overview

**My name is Javier Hernández, alias Doc, and I'm a senior technical writer.** I love learning, and this is what I love from being a technical writer:  

* I can learn continuously (from users, developers, and subject-matter experts)  

* I can improve the communication between users and product development teams  

* I can support product development teams to improve their documentation

**Technical writing is all about learning** the language and the needs of your readers, and finding a way for successful communication.   

## Previous Projects  

**I'm a computer network manager, and a translator (and literary critic and a poet too).** This hybrid background makes me eager to learn and keep in mind the users' (readers') point of view.
