# About Me       

## Overview

**My name is Javier Hernández, alias _Doc_, and I'm a senior technical writer**. I love learning, that's why I'm a technical writer:   

* to learn continuously (from users, developers and subject matter experts)  
* to be able to ease the process of how they communicate with each other  
* to help product development team to achieve their documentation goals

**Technical writing is all about learning the language and the needs of your readers (developers, end-suers, subject-matter experts),** and then finding a way for communication to be accomplished. 

**Now I am learning** Python (for AI and scripting), Large Language Models (LLMs) _prompting_ and GitHub Actions.
Sound cool, right?    

## Previous Projects  

**I have a hybrid background (Computer Network manager, translator and poet)** which allows me to be always prone to learn and keep in mind the user's point of view. That's why learning is always a requirement for any new project.   

**Mercedes-Bez.io, Infinera and Aplicaciones Informáticas Domingo Alonso (AIDA)** are my latest technical documentation projects. Each of them has a special place in my journey as a professional:  

|Project | Long Story Short |
