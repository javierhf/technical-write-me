# Before Hiring a Technical Writer     

## Overview    

**The decision of hiring a technical writer comes after targeting a need** in our product development. In this case we may need to improve an existing documentation project (user guides, API or developer documentation) or create our product's documentation from scratch.  

Whatever our case may be, in this article I'll share some ideas to consider before hiring a technical writer.  

## Identify Your Project Needs and Resources   

**Before starting to sail LinkedIn or Internet** for a technical writer, consider the following table with questions to identify your needs and resources better:      

| Question |  Helps you to |  
|------------- |-------------- |   
| **Why do you need a technical writer?**<ul><li>Just to manage and improve your existing  documentation?</li><li>To create your product or development documentation?</li></ul> |State and visualize the technical writing needs of your product.|  
| **What type of documentation do you need a technical writer for?**<ul><li>API documentation</li><li>User guides</li><li>Project documentation? Developer documentation?</li></ul> | Hire the right technical writer and determine your priority.|    
| **How do you picture your documentation?** | Explain the technical writer your idea or what you are expecting. |  
| **What is you budget for a technical writer?** | Estimate the project and contract duration in advance so that the technical writers can prioritize what needs to be done.|
  
**Having a previous idea of what we want and how long we can pay for it:**   

* allows us to establish a fair professional relationship with our future technical writer  
* allows the technical writer to plan and align with our expectations
