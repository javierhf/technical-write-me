## First Steps     

**Developer Documentation is a curated set of files** describing all the active *workflows*, *setups*, *tools*, *conventions*, *best practices*, and *How-tos* of your software development product. Through this article, I will refer to it as "documentation" or "docs".

Documentation supports your team members in their daily and future developments. It also helps new joiners to reach cruise speed during the onboarding period. *But to do so, your documentation must be up-to-date and well-structured*. 

Keeping the docs up-to-date and in good shape requires resources and dedicated time. Yet often our project time or budget constraints prevent us from taking care of our docs properly. 

This series of articles aims to serve as a documentation improvement guide. 

## Know Your Ground


### Step 1 - Organize Your Improvement Project   

**Developer documentation has to be visible** to increase the chances of success, and to find collaborators (to improve it). To do so, keeping a *space* to visualize, describe and track your improvement project is a useful idea.  

**Use your teams/company collaboration tool** for that purpose. For this article, we'll be using Confluence.    

  
#### Space Structure  

**The structure of an improvement project may differ** from one project to another. Take the following *space* structure as a reference that you can adapt to your needs (*then iterate!*):    

| Space Name | Page Name | Child Page| Description |  
|------ | ------ | -------| --- |  
| **[Your Documentation Project´s Name]** | | | Name of your documentation project. |  
| | **Overview** | | Explain briefly the What, Why and How of the documentation. |    
| | **Dashboard** | | Centralized page to easily access all project pages. |  
| | **Analysis** | | Media and results of documentation analysis. |  
| | **Roadmap**  | | Visualization of the estimated dates to implement each improvement. |  
| | **Improvement Project** | *Communication Grid* | Contact person by topic. |   
| | | *Improvement Plan* |  Implementation phases and items. |   
| | | *Coordination Meetings* | Grid to align with your manager or collaborators (_Optional_). |   
 


**Once your improvement project space is set up,** you are ready to:

* Present it to all your team members, including Product Owners and Scrum Masters.  
* Track and show your progress.  
* Visualize documentation issues/blocking points.  
* Access all your project resources.  

> **Tip:** Explain how documentation issues negatively impact teams´ performance. It will help Product Owners and Scrum Masters to understand and provide your project with the resources you need.

### Step 2 - Identify Your Documentation Issues  

**Identifying your documentation issues means** spotting all the types of issues living among your docs. Some documentation issues are:  

* Grammar, spelling and syntax errors.  
* Confusing/Not logical page structure.  
* Unclear/Verbose text.

In the following table, you can learn a little more about the main documentation issues:

| Documentation Issue | Fix strategy |   
| ------| --- |   
| **Grammar, spelling, syntax** | Use a text checker to support your writing. Some good options are [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/), [Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com/) or [QuillBot](https://quillbot.com/grammar-check).  |  
| **Page structure** | Review your page structure. It shows the logical flow of the information contained according to the objective of the page, for example: *Introduction*, *Prerequisites*, *First Step*, *Working with.../Available Features*. |  
| **Naming** | Define a naming strategy for page titles, sections and subsections. |  
| **Page elements** |Standardize the use of the following elements: lists, tables, tabs, notes, collapsible elements and images. |    
| **Text unclear** or **too verbose** |  Be concise.|  
| **Random text formatting** | Standardize the use of bold and italics for files, folder names, code snippets and code elements (functions, objects, methods, parameters, API names, etc.). |  
| **Too many topics on a single page** | Stick to "One topic per page". |   
| **Unnecessary screenshots** | Use screenshots or images _ONLY_ when strictly necessary. If you can explain it briefly, do not use screenshots. |  
| **Type of notes** | Standardize each type of use case for notes (Info, Help, Warning, etc.). |
