# Developer Documentation Survival Kit 

## Overview  

**Product development project benefits from maintaining a good and effective documentation.** However, development teams are usually tied by strong budget constraints.   

This articles aims to offer a reduced version of the [Improving an existing documentation](./../improving-documentation-projects-1/) articles providing small bit of key ideas, both easy to learn and to implement steadily.   

But remember, managing and improving a documentation project requires the absolute commitment and  of all management roles and the development teams.

## Prerequisites  

- [x] Commitment to improve your documentation.
- [x] Direct communication with Product Owners and Scrum Masters 
- [x] Save a small slot of time for documentation work.   

## Swiss Knife    

**How can you manage and improve your documentation project** when you don't have that much time? First, you have to ensure that all the previous _prerequisites_ are satisfied. Then you get the following swiss knife (a conceptual knive ;)) to trigger and manage your documentation efforts.  

## Knowing Your Ground  

**Know your ground before taking any further step.** If you don't know where your, the current state of your process how can you possible decide where to start or what to do next?  

**Knowing your ground** about your documentation project means to:  

1. Analyse your documentation.  
2. Identify the current issues.
3. Name your project's needs regarding the documentation.  
 

**Why is that?** Analyzing your documentation provides you with a first hand knowledge of the real health of your documentation. Therefore it makes it easier to identify the current issues. Only then we'll be able to compare _the current status of our documentation_ to the needs of our project.   

## Where to Start?    

**Knowing your ground can be a terrifying experience** leaving in a hopeless-like state of mind. _Despair do not!_ There's always a small and easy step to take. Then _just iterate!_    

### Step 1 - Prioritize and Plan your Efforts  

**Now that you know your ground** it's time to prioritize and then plan your documentation efforts. But how? Well, we can prioritize our documentation efforts considering the following two ideas:  

* The most critical - Start with the topic which is the most critical for the development project
* The most valuable - Start with the topic that will allow to provide more value to the customer  

Of course, if we can find a middle way we'll double the benefits.    

**Once you have prioritize** remember to:  

1. Save a slot of time to manage/improve your documentation.  
2. Set a reminder script or a GitHub Action to review your docs.

   Working on your documentation on a daily basis sounds non-business objectives compliant. Doing it on a weekly basis seems more realistic and flexible.
