!!! help ""  

    Taking care of your documentation makes your work more efficient, and contributes to your users' satisfaction.

## Overview  

**Product development project benefits from maintaining a good and effective documentation.** However, development teams are usually tied by strong budget constraints when it comes to hire a technical writer.   

**This articles aims to offer a easy to handle swiss knife,** armed with the key ideas you can apply to manage and improve your documentation project.   

But remember, managing and improving a documentation project requires the *commitment and of all management roles and the development teams*.

## Prerequisites  

- [x] Commitment to improve/manage your documentation
- [x] Direct communication with management roles 
- [x] Save a small slot of time for documentation work  

## Swiss Knife    

**The swiss knife to manage and improve documentation projects** includes the following set of fundamental blades:  

* Know Your Ground  
* Know Your Documentation Needs  
* Prioritize and Plan  
* Commitment  
* _Iterate!_

In the following sections we'll talk more about these _blades_.  

## Blade 1 - Knowing Your Ground  

**Know your ground before taking any further step.** Knowing your ground means _to know the deficiencies of our documentation_, and _identify what is preventing it from being successfull and effective_.  

**To know your ground you have to analyse your documentation** for example considering the elements of following checklist:

- [ ] My documentation provide all the information any user needs to understand:   
> - _What it is_  
> - _What they can do_   
> - _What they need to do it_  
> - _How to do it_  
- [ ] My documentation provides a prerequisites_ when required
- [ ] My documentation is clear enough for any type of users 
- [ ] My documentation is clear, specific and concise (no verbosity)
- [ ] A clear workflow is implemented to review and update the documentation  
- [ ] My documentation mirror the natural workflow of regular users. 

 **Those items you have not ticked** are the onw you need to tackle:  
 
 > "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for ~mankind~ my documentation."   
 
 Knowing your ground can be a terrifying experience leaving in a hopeless-like state of mind. But despair do not! Be patient, take small steps. Then _iterate!_    


## Blade 2 - Know Your Documentation Needs     

**If the Oracle of Delphi had managed documentation,** it might have said:   

> "Know your documentation needs."  

**Knowing your documentation needs helps you to contextualize** the insights you've gained using the _knowing your ground_ blade.  


**To know our documentation needs** answer the following questions:  

- Do I need a coherent (single) writing style for my documentation?  
- Do I need a full-blended documentation to support my customers' success?  
- Do I need a writing style guide?  
- Do I just need to increase clarity?  
- Do I just need to reduce verbosisty?  
- Do I need to review and update my documentation?    
- Do I know what my users think about my documentation?
- What is the *minimum viable and valuable documentation* for my project/product?  
  
Now you are in a good shape to _prioritize and plan_ your documentation effort.


## Blade 3 - Prioritize and Plan your Documentation Effort  

**Every project is different** and knowing your ground and knowing your needs will give the insights you need. So now it's time to prioritize and plan your documentation efforts. *But how?*  

**To prioritize your documentation efforts** you have to identify the most critical and the most valuable topic or issue.   

Starting with the most critical topic means that you will address the topic which is the most critical to develop your product in the first place.  

Starting with the most valuable topic means you will address the topic that provides more value to your customer or project in the first place.   

**Once you have prioritize what to start improving or managing** create a roadmap to track and update your progress.

    Consider the most critical topic and the most valuable depending on your product, project and business objective.

## Blade 4 - Commitment   

**Now that you know your ground and your needs, and after prioritizing**, it is fundamental that you or your team commit to improve and manage your documentation actively and regularly.   

**Committing t improve and manage your documentation** actively and regularly requires some discipline and strenght. _May the Foce be with you!_

**To use your commit blade proficiently** follow these steps:

1. Save a slot of time to manage/improve your documentation.    
2. Create a reminder.  
3. Inform other teammembers about that.  
4. Stick to it unless there is an emergency.
