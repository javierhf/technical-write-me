## Overview  

**Product development project benefits from having good and effective documentation.** However, budget constraints are often an obstacle to achieving that goal by hiring a technical writer.  

**This article offers an easy-to-handle Swiss knife** with the key ideas you need to manage and improve your documentation project.  

## Prerequisites   

!!! info "Info"  

    Improving any documentation project, requires the commitment of both management roles and  development teams.

- [x] Commitment to improve/manage your documentation
- [x] Direct communication with management roles 
- [x] Save a small slot of time for documentation work  

## Swiss Knife      

!!! info "Reminder"  

    Good documentation makes your work more efficient, and contributes to your users' satisfaction.

**The swiss knife to manage and improve documentation projects** includes the following set of fundamental ideas (blades):  

* Know Your Ground  
* Know Your Documentation Needs  
* Prioritize and Plan  
* Commitment  
* _Iterate!_

In the following sections we'll talk more about these _blades_.  

### Blade 1 - Knowing Your Ground  

**Know your ground before taking any further step.** Knowing your ground means: 

> To know the deficiencies of our documentation, and identify what is preventing it from being successfull and effective.  

**To know your ground, analyse your documentation** and consider the following checklist:

- [ ] My documentation provide all the information any user needs to understand:   
> - _What it is_  
> - _What they can do_   
> - _What they need to do it_  
> - _How to do it_  
- [ ] My documentation provides a prerequisites_ when required
- [ ] My documentation is clear enough for any type of users 
- [ ] My documentation is clear, specific and concise (no verbosity)
- [ ] A clear workflow is implemented to review and update the documentation  
- [ ] My documentation mirror the natural workflow of regular users. 

**The items you have not ticked** are the ones you need to tackle  

Knowing your ground can be a terrifying experience leaving in a hopeless-like state of mind. But despair do not! Be patient, take small steps. Then _iterate!_    


### Blade 2 - Know Your Documentation Needs     

**If the Oracle of Delphi had managed documentation,** it might have said:   

> "Know your documentation needs."  

**Knowing your documentation needs helps you to contextualize** the insights you've gained using the _knowing your ground_ blade.  

**To know our documentation needs** answer the following questions:  

- Do I need a coherent (single) writing style for my documentation?  
- Do I need a full-blended documentation to support my customers' success?  
- Do I need a writing style guide?  
- Do I just need to increase clarity?  
- Do I just need to reduce verbosisty?  
- Do I need to review and update my documentation?    
- Do I know what my users think about my documentation?
- What is the *minimum viable and valuable documentation* for my project/product?  
  
Now you are in a good shape to _prioritize and plan_ your documentation effort.


### Blade 3 - Prioritize and Plan your Documentation Effort  

**Every project is different** and knowing your ground and knowing your needs increase the knowledge of your own project. With these new insights, you can now prioritize and plan.

**To prioritize your documentation efforts** you have to identify:  

* the most critical topic/issue  
* the most valuable topic/issue.   

**Starting with the most critical** topic means that you will *address the topic which is the most critical to develop your product* in the first place.  

**Starting with the most valuable** topic means that you will *address the topic that provides more value to your customer or project* in the first place.   

**Once you have prioritize what to start improving or managing** create a roadmap or a prioritize backlog to track and update your progress.

    Consider the most critical topic and the most valuable depending on your product, project and business objective.

### Blade 4 - Commitment     

!!! info "Info"  

    Improving any documentation project, requires the commitment of both management roles and  development teams.

**Now that you know your ground and your needs, and after prioritizing**, it time to commit to improve and manage your documentation actively and regularly.   

**To support and reinforce you commitment** try these steps:

1. Save a slot of time to manage/improve your documentation.    
2. Create a reminder.  
3. Involve other team members.  
4. Inform management roles about this.  
5. Stick to it unless there is an emergency.

!!! help "Help"  

    Setting a reminder in Outlook or using a script or GitHub Action is really helpful.
