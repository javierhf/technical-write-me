# Technical-Write Me

## Overview  

**My name is Javier Hern√°ndez, alias _Doc_, and I'm a senior technical writer**. This is my experience repository and articles pond where you will find my resume and articles about technical writing, documentation management and other related topics about the job.   

**I use [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) as static-site generator** and GitHub Actions (_Coming soon!_) to automate the deployment of the pages.

Hope you find it useful.
