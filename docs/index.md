## About My Previous Projects  

**I have a hybrid background (Computer Network manager, translator and poet)** which allows me to be always prone to learn and keep in mind the user's point of view. That's why learning is always a requirement for any new project.   

_Mercedes-Benz.io_ (2021-2023), _Infinera_ and _Aplicaciones Informáticas Domingo Alonso (AIDA)_ are my latest technical documentation projects.
