## About My Previous Projects  

**I have a hybrid background (Computer Network manager, translator and poet)** which allows me to be always prone to learn and keep in mind the user's point of view. That's why learning is always a requirement for any new project.   

_Mercedes-Benz.io_ (2021-2023), _Infinera_ and _Aplicaciones Informáticas Domingo Alonso (AIDA)_ are my latest technical documentation projects. Each of them has a special place in my jorney as a professional:  

* Mercedes-Bez.io - In this project I could apply all of my previous learnings and ideas regarding project management, community building, communication strategy and improvement planning and prioritization.  
* Infinera - This was the place where my project management skills were consolidated.  
* Aplicaciones Informáticas Domingo Alonso (AIDA) -  My first technical writing project where I learn the fundamentals, Us Design and the Agile mindset.
