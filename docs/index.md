# Technical-Write Me  
!!! warning "Under construction"  

    This repository and web page is under construction. _Stay tuned!_

## Overview  

**My name is Javier Hernández, alias _Doc_, and I'm a senior technical writer**. This is my experience repository and articles pond where you will find my resume and articles about technical writing, documentation management and other related topics about the job.   

**I use [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) as static-site generator** and GitHub Actions (_Coming soon!_) to automate the deployment of the pages.

Hope you find it useful.  

## Briefing About My Previous Projects  

**I have a hybrid background (Computer Network manager, translator and poet)** which allows me to be always prone to learn and keep in mind the user's point of view. That's why learning is always a requirement for any new project.
