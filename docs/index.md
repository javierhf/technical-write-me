## About My Previous Projects  

**I have a hybrid background (Computer Network manager, translator and poet)** which allows me to be always prone to learn and keep in mind the user's point of view. That's why learning is always a requirement for any new project.   

**Mercedes-Bez.io, Infinera and Aplicaciones Informáticas Domingo Alonso (AIDA)** are my latest technical documentation projects. Each of them has a special place in my jorney as a professional:  

* [Mercedes-Benz.io](https://www.mercedes-benz.io/) - My latest project (2021 - 2023). Here I could apply all of my previous learnings and ideas regarding project management, community building, communication strategy and improvement planning and prioritization.  
* [Infinera](https://www.infinera.com/) - This was the place where my project management skills were consolidated.  
* [Aplicaciones Informáticas Domingo Alonso (AIDA)](https://www.domingoalonsogroup.com/en/branchs/aida) -  My first technical writing project where I learn the fundamentals, UX Design and the Agile mindset.
