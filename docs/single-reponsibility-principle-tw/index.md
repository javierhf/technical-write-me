# Single-Responsibility Principle for Documentation Projects   
## Overview  

**According to Wikipedia the Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP) is:**  

> a computer programming principle that states that "A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor."

**This term was created by Robert C. Martin who expresses the principle as:  

> A class should have only one reason to change".

The word "reason" caused some controversy within the community** so he had to provide further clarification say that the "principle is about people." He also added that the principle's focus is _roles_ or _actors_.

Ideally we'll a single persona fitting a single role (and responsibilities) but we know that is not always possible. In fact, technical writers often perform the tasks of some of these roles (collaborators, reviewers, managers) in _developer documentation_ projects.
