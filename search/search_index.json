Knowing this, we can take further actions to deepen the engagement, or reinforce it if the docs are not being checked frequently.

Level of (dis)satisfaction 5, 6 A satisfied user is another word for useful docs (and product!). A low level of satisfaction gives us the chance to ask Why?, and find the source of that dissatisfaction. Usefulness perception 7, 8 We can think that our documentation is useful but, again, our users will either confirm it or deny it. Another opportunity to improve. Access point to our documentation 9 Sometimes we think that our users access directly our documentation typing the URL in the browser. This question will tell us about the bookmarking habits of our users bookmark. With that in mind, we will have a better idea of the impacts of changing any page or section name that could probably be bookmarked. Here, an effective and reliable communication strategy for changes is key.
